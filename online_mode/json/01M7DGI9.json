{"level_name":"HIRO","questions":[{"answer":"Network","question":"A collection of interconnected devices (such as computers, printers, and servers) that can communicate and share resources with each other."},{"answer":"Protocol","question":"A set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. It defines how devices should communicate with each other."},{"answer":"IP Address","question":"A unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network. It is used to identify and locate devices on the internet or a local network."},{"answer":"Router","question":"A networking device that directs data traffic between different networks. It determines the most efficient path for data to travel and helps devices on a local network connect to the internet."},{"answer":"Hub","question":"A basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a network. Unlike a switch, it does not intelligently forward data and instead broadcasts data to all connected devices."},{"answer":"DNS (Domain Name System)","question":"A system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to locate each other on the internet."},{"answer":"Gateway IP Address","question":"It is the IP address of the router or gateway that connects a local network to other networks, such as the internet."},{"answer":"NAT (Network Address Translation)","question":"A technique used by routers to map multiple private IP addresses on a local network to a single public IP address for internet access."},{"answer":"Router Table","question":"A data structure on a router that contains information about the routes to reach different network destinations."},{"answer":"Subnet","question":"A nlogical subdivision of an IP network. It helps manage and organize IP addresses within a network."},{"answer":"Gateway","question":"A device or software that connects two different networks, allowing them to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge between networks with different protocols."},{"answer":"Bandwidth","question":"Refers to the capacity or speed at which data can be transmitted over a network. It is typically measured in bits per second (bps) or megabits per second (Mbps)."},{"answer":"Packet","question":"A small unit of data that is transmitted over a network. Data is divided into packets for efficient transmission and reassembled at its destination."},{"answer":"TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)","question":"A reliable and connection-oriented protocol used for data transmission on the internet. It ensures data integrity and delivery."},{"answer":"UDP (User Datagram Protocol)","question":"A connectionless and less reliable protocol used for faster data transmission when some loss of data is acceptable."},{"answer":"MAC Address","question":"A unique hardware address assigned to network interfaces, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapters. It is used at the data link layer to identify devices on a local network."}],"time":1200}
